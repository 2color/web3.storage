# Web3.Storage API (1.0)

Download OpenAPI specification:Download

This documentation describes the HTTP API for (Web3.Storage)[https://web3.storage], which allows you to quickly and easily build applications using decentralized data storage persisted by (Filecoin)[https://filecoin.io/] and available over (IPFS)[https://ipfs.io/].

You can also interact with this API using client libraries. See (web3.storage/docs)[https://web3.storage/docs] for more information on using a client library, as well as a variety of other guides and how-tos for Web3.Storage as a whole.

## API endpoint URL

The main public API endpoint URL for Web3.Storage is https://api.web3.storage. All endpoints described in this document should be made relative to this root URL. For example, to post to the /car endpoint, send your request to https://api.web3.storage/car.

### Rate limits

This API imposes rate limits to ensure quality of service. You may receive a 429 "Too many requests" error if you make more than 30 requests with the same API token within a ten second window. Upon receiving a response with a 429 status, clients should retry the failed request after a small delay. To avoid 429 responses, you may wish to implement client-side request throttling to stay within the limits.

## Authentication

### bearerAuth

The Web3.Storage API uses bearer tokens to authenticate requests. You can view and manage these tokens on the (API Tokens page)[https://web3.storage/tokens/] in your Web3.Storage account dashboard.

Your tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret tokens in publicly accessible locations such as a GitHub repository, client-side code, and so forth.

**Bearer authentication** (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The term “bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Security Scheme Type | HTTP
HTTP Authorization Scheme | bearer
Bearer format | "JWT"
